## Motivation

- Financial news sentiment increasingly drives markets, especially during political or economic events.
  
- Traditional models rely on numbers, overlooking emotional and public opinion effects.

- Prior sentiment models reduce news to sentiment scores, missing word-level nuances.

- We propose IKNet, an interpretable keyword-guided model integrating FinBERT sentiment with technical indicators for next-day price prediction.

## Contribution

- IKNet integrates keyword sentiment with technical indicators to enhance stock prediction accuracy, interpretability, and profitability.

- Our keyword-level sentiment representation enables explainability of how specific terms affect market trends.

- By visualizing semantic causality between opinion keywords and future stock prices, it enables efficient investment strategies.
