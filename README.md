## 🧠 Overview
**IKNet** is an interpretable deep learning model that integrates **FinBERT-based keyword embeddings** from financial news with **technical indicators** to predict the next-day closing price of the S&P 500 index.  
Unlike prior models that average document embeddings or rely on sentiment scores, IKNet provides **keyword-level explanations** of how public sentiment influences price movement using **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)**.

## 🧩 Model Architecture

Figure 1: Architecture of the proposed IKNet model.

The IKNet model consists of four main modules:

(a) **FinBERT-based Keyword Extraction** – identifies contextually salient keywords from daily financial news using gradient-based saliency.

(b) **Keyword Encoder** – processes extracted keyword embeddings via independent MLP projection and GRU sequence encoder.

(c) **Technical Indicator Encoder** – encodes structured OHLCV-based features using a Bi-LSTM network.

(d) **Feature Fusion & Prediction** – concatenates both representations for next-day price forecasting.
