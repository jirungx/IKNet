## Motivation

- Financial news sentiment increasingly drives markets, especially during political or economic events.
  
- Traditional models rely on numbers, overlooking emotional and public opinion effects.

- Prior sentiment models reduce news to sentiment scores, missing word-level nuances.

- We propose IKNet, an interpretable keyword-guided model integrating FinBERT sentiment with technical indicators for next-day price prediction.
